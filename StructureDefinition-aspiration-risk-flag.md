| Patient-level aspiration-risk finding — the minimal, most safety-critical element carried across transitions. The at-risk-for-aspiration finding is asserted by`Observation.code`; the mere PRESENCE of a final instance is the datum the care-transition consistency rule consumes (the rule does not read the value). Status is fixed to final so that every conformant instance is visible to the rule (the rule accepts final | amended, a superset), closing the profile↔rule gap. An optional qualifier value may record the observed aspiration event on which the risk determination was based. |
